# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *LOESS*

*Write a paragraph describing what the software does and who its
primary audience is.*
Loess.jl is a Julia package that provides an implementation of the LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) algorithm for non-parametric regression analysis. The package includes functions for computing local regression estimates and for generating diagnostic plots. LOESS is a flexible method for smoothing data and fitting curves to it by estimating a locally weighted regression line at each point. It is particularly useful when dealing with data that has non-linear relationships or significant noise. The primary audience for this package is statisticians and data analysts who work with large datasets and need a tool for non-parametric regression analysis
